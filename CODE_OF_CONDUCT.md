# DEICER Code of Conduct and Privacy Commitment

## Our Mission

DEICER is committed to empowering communities through constitutionally protected information sharing while maintaining the highest standards of privacy, security, and responsible use. Like other community safety apps such as Waze, we facilitate the constitutional right to gather and share public information about law enforcement activities.

## Legal Foundation

Our platform's core functionality is protected by established case law:

- **First Amendment Protection**: In *Glik v. Cunniffe* (2011), the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed that citizens have a constitutionally protected right to record law enforcement in public spaces.
- **Equal Rights**: The court emphasized that "the public's right of access to information is coextensive with that of the press."
- **Public Space Recording**: *Smith v. City of Cumming* (2000) established that citizens have the right to record matters of public interest.
- **Constitutional Protection**: These rights apply to all persons within U.S. jurisdiction, regardless of citizenship status (*Yick Wo v. Hopkins*, 1886).
